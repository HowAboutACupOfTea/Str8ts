# str8ts-HowAboutACupOfTea
This program can solve str8ts of varying difficulties with a backtracking algorithm.
It uses a string representation of a str8t as input. For example:
b0,b0,w0,w0,w5,w0,w0,b3,b0;w0,w6,w0,w0,b0,b0,w1,w0,w0;w0,w0,w0,b0,b8,w0,w0,w0,w0;w9,w0,w0,b4,w0,w0,w0,b0,b5;b0,w0,w0,w0,w0,w3,w0,w0,b0;b0,b0,w0,w0,w0,b9,w0,w4,w0;w4,w0,w3,w0,b0,b0,w0,w6,w0;w0,w0,w1,b0,b0,w0,w0,w0,w0;b0,b0,w8,w0,w0,w0,w0,b0,b2

Where 'b' stands for black, 'w' for white, a comma ',' seperates columns and a semicolon ';' seperates rows.

A console renderer for visualizing the str8t and its solving process is included.
The solving of differently sized str8ts is supported.

The unit tests for testing the program are included in the files.
